{\textbf{Variable Computation in Recurrent Neural Networks:}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Modified a RNN model to reduce the amount of required computation by ignoring redundant sequences.
        \item Implemented a scheduler for the RNN unit which decides the computation required at the current time-step.
        \item Reduced the number of operations for bit-level language modelling by 50\%.
    \end{itemize}
}

\cvitem{2019}
{\textbf{RISC Processor Design using HDL}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Designed, programmed and tested 16-bit multi-cycle processor for a given set of instructions and constraints.
    \item Followed modular approach for programming the processor and its test bench, by dividing it into sub-modules such as memory, register file, ALU and control unit.
\end{itemize}
}

\cvitem{2018}
{\textbf{FIR flter design using an adjustable window function.}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implemented an adjustable window function based on the combination of Blackman and Lanczos window.
    \item Achieved a 75\% better side-lobe roll off ratio than Lanczos window.
\end{itemize}
}
