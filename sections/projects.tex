\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Variable Computation in Recurrent Neural Networks:}
    {
    \begin{itemize}
    
        \item Modified a RNN model to make it learn to vary the amount of computation according to the sequence that they process.
        
        \item Implemented a scheduler for the RNN unit which decides the computation required at the current time-step.
        
        \item Reduced the number of operations for bit-level language modelling to around 50\% compared to normal RNN unit.
        
    \end{itemize}
    }

    \item \textbf{RISC Processor Design using HDL}
    {
    \begin{itemize}
    
        \item Designed, programmed and tested 16-bit multi-cycle processor for a given set of instructions and constraints.
        
        \item Followed modular approach for programming the processor and its test bench, by dividing it into sub-modules such as memory, register file, ALU and control unit.
